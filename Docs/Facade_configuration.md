# Facade configuration

The configuration for the facade's (PHP) logic is located in `Config/AngularMaterialFacade.config.json`.

Common configuration keys of AJAX facades (those inherited from the `AbstractAjaxFacade`) are described in the [core facade documentation](https://github.com/ExFace/Core/blob/master/Docs/developer_docs/Facades/HTML_facades_based_on_AbstractAjaxFacade/Configuration_of_AJAX_facades.md).
